				<p>Our universe contains an amazing array of celestial objects, sometimes referred to as celestial bodies or astronomical objects. Though most of the observable cosmos is composed of empty space, this cold, dark void that is sparsely populated by a number of astronomical objects that range from the common to the bizarre. Known collectively by astronomers as celestial objects, celestial bodies, astronomical objects, and astronomical bodies, they are the stuff that fills the empty space of the universe. Most of us are familiar with the stars, planets, and moons. But beyond these everyday celestial objects, lies an amazing collection of other wondrous sights. There are colorful nebulae, delicate star clusters, and massive galaxies. Pulsars and quasars add to the mystery, while black holes swallow up every bit of matter that comes too close. And now, the search is on to identify the mysterious, invisible objects known as dark matter. Join Sea and Sky for an intriguing journey as we discover these amazing celestial objects.</p>
