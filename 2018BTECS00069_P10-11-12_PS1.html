			<h2>Projects completed</h2>
			<h3>1. Atomatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser</h3>
			<p>We created a prototype with electrical control circuit and viable mechanical design to prove the viability of our idea. Our prototype was meant to replicate a countertop unit that washed a user’s hands in consistent manner. The prototype used simpler, less expensive components to dispense the sanitizer without any requirement for user to touch anything. This touch-free was accomplished with an operation with the infrared sensor and LED that began the process. The entire device was fully functional by the end of testing and allowed to provide evidence of the viability of our design.</p>
			<p>The Target for this product is mostly Households situated in Maharashtra and other major cities located nearby. The Marketing strategy and sales plan is well planned in order to deliver this product with ease directly to the doorsteps of customer. The designed product is made available with a huge capacity of 3L, low maintenance and in a very cost-effective price. Disinfection and sanitization process is made way easier and faster with the help of this product. There is low wastage of sanitizer with a convenient spray technology for hand sanitization which sprays the certain amount of sanitizer for each time of its use. This all process is completely Touch free and resource conscious.</p>
			<p>We have created a Youtube link for <a href="https://youtu.be/TczRtrzdd-k">Atomatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser</a>.</p>
