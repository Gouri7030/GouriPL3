			<p>This week many of my readers will celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>
			<p>So I thought it would be a good time to share a handful of my favorite tips for making thankfulness a daily part of life.</p>
			<p>Because being thankful for what you have is one of the simplest and easiest ways to lift your mood. To give your motivation a jolt. And to live a happier life.</p>
			<p>No matter who you are or where you live in the world.</p>
		</article>

			<h2>1. Pause and look around yourself.</h2>
			<p>A simple first step to being more thankful is to pause during your day and ask yourself these two questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are 3 things I can be thankful for in my life today?</li>
				<li>Who are 3 people I can be thankful to have in my life and why?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you don’t come up with 3 people and 3 things each day then that is OK. One thing or person is great too.</p>
			<p>But if you can, try to not repeat yourself too often.</p>
			<p>Instead, think of more people and things to be grateful for to, day by day, expand your thankful view of your world.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h2>2. Express your thankfulness.</h2>
			<p>Don’t stop at just coming up with people for whom you are grateful to have in your life.</p>
			<p>Take a few seconds to tell them about it. This will make their lives happier. And as their faces light up with a smile you’ll feel happier too.</p>
			<p>Now, that gratitude could just be a small sentence. But it can have a big impact on someone’s day, week or even life.</p>
			<p>So be sure to make the small effort to express it.</p>
		</article>

			<h2>3. Look towards yourself too.</h2>
			<p>It is not only things that are important. Or other people.</p>
			<p>You are important and valuable too.</p>
			<p>So appreciate that.</p>
			<p>Ask yourself:</p>
			<p>What are 3 things I can be thankful for about myself?</p>
			<p>It could be that you were a good sister during a crisis last week. It could be that you finally got done with that boring or difficult task you had been procrastinating on.
			<p>Your self-gratitude does not have to be all about achievements.
			<p>You can simply be thankful for your good sense of humor. Or the help you give your friends and family by being a good listener from time to time.
			<p>And the thankfulness doesn’t have to be about big things either. It could simply be about the fact that you floss for a couple of minutes in the morning.

			<h2>4. Be thankful for the things you may take for granted.</h2>
			<p>The things we get very used to having can become things we take for granted. But they are not things everyone in the world has access to.
			<p>A few such things that I like to reflect upon and feel very thankful for having are:
			<ul>
				<li>A roof over my head and a warm home.</li>
				<li>Plenty of drinkable water.</li>
				<li>That I don’t have to go hungry.</li>
				<li>Being able to enjoy the small and free pleasures of life.</li>
				<li>Access to the internet so that I can learn and connect with people.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I have found that being grateful for things like these are especially helpful to zoom out and to put my situation in perspective when I am going through a tough time in life.</p>

			<h2>5. Start or end your day with thankfulness.</h2>
			<p>To make thankfulness into a habit that sticks find a regular time for it in your day.
			<p>For example, you can start your day in a good way by finding 3 things to be grateful for about yourself over breakfast.
			<p>Or you can take a few minutes in the evening, just before going to bed, to use a journal to write down 3 things you are grateful for about your day.
			<p>Try a tiny time commitment like one of these and see what impact it has on your life.
