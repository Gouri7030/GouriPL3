				<h3>INTRODUCTION TO TIGERS</h3>
				<p>Tigers are terrestrial mammals that belong to the genus “Panthera” a classification that groups the five species of big cats: lions, jaguars, leopards, snow leopards, and tigers. They are easily recognizable by their unique black striped pattern on a dark orange coat and because they are the largest species of the Felidae family. The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest of the five big cats that belong to the genus “Panthera.”</p>
				<h3>BORN TO KILL</h3>
				<p>Their elegant gait, haughty demeanor, and their dynamic movements are an example of an adapted anatomy for hunting. Since tigers are at the top of the food chain, they are considered super-predators.</p>
				<h3>LONELY PREDATOR</h3>
				<p>Unlike lions, tigers tend to roam and hunt alone. However, on occasions, they share the prey with other tigers which is a good indication of their level of sociability.</p>
				<p>If you expect to see a streak of tigers, you will not get lucky. These cats differ from lions because they usually roam alone. They hunt, feed and rest without the company of other tigers and lack a defined social structure. However, from time to time they hang around with others, and evidently, they interact during mating.</p>
				<h3>CONSERVATION</h3>
				<p>People’s fear of tigers have made them be depreciated and accused of attacking men, which has contributed to some extent to their current situation. Also, they continuously face threats such as poaching and habitat loss, which has put them in a grave danger of extinction.</p>
				<p>From the six subspecies, three are “Endangered, ” and three are “Critically Endangered” being the southern Chinese tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) the most threatened of all since for more than 25 years there have not been records of sightings in the wild.</p>
				<p>The conservation status of the tiger is adverse, and the global population keeps reducing. Many organizations and governments are doing an arduous work to protect and preserve these cats.</p>
